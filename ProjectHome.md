This is the place where the dream starts to become reality and we will try to start to bring it all together; from our infinity to the stars and beyond. Come join us in our journey to bring others into that dream and help the community to grow, learn, and do some good for the future of gaming to the next level.

This is the project site for the infinity client. The project was founded in March of 2010 under the name “Runedev” by a group of java hobby programmers who simply wanted to bring our joy for java and our idea of the use game macros together.
